## Description
As  Full-Stack Web Developers, we wanted to create a tool to help individuals prioritize their mental well-being, by allowing them to track their mood daily and complete journal entries with predetermined questions. Each day the user will be able to select their mood for the day, add a journal entry, add a photo and submit for tracking.
